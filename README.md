# Introduction

This plugin introduces a component placeholder machanism. It places a holder component at the original place of each child component and manages the creation/mounting/destroy of child components by the plugin itself. Each of these child components becomes an "mvm" (managed vm). If vue adds/deletes/updates the holder components, the plugin applies the same changes on the mvms. Since the mvms are totally managed by the plugin, it is possible to inject some (asynchronized) custom hooks before and after their creation/mounting, which makes it handy to deal with asynchronous data. For example, this plugin injects an "asyncData" hook for every mvm, not only for page components as [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/api/).

To tag a child component as an mvm, we wrap it with a placeholder component "vue-holder" as follows:

```html
<!-- MyParentComponent.vue -->
<template>
<div>
  <vue-holder name="MyFavoriteName">
    <MyChildComponent />
  </vue-holder>
</template>
```

To prevent vue from creating the child components and change them to mvms, we need to edit the AST generated by "vue-component-compiler". This is done by the "holdify" function we inject into "vue-loader" (details in [Installation](#Installation)). The child's template will be moved from the default slot to the template attribute. Some other attributes will be added if necessary (details in [Holdify](#Holdify)).

```html
<vue-holder name="MyFavoriteName" template="<MyChildComponent />">
</vue-holder>
```

Then, the plugin could make a render function for this mvm based on the "template" and some other attributes of the wrapping "vue-holder". It would wait for the code chunk before running the render function if the child component is composed asynchronously. It could also run some asynchronized custom hooks to fetch data or update stores as follows:

```js
/** MyChildComponent.vue */
<template>
<div>
  <div>Name: {{ name }}</div>
  <div>Recommendations: {{ $store.state.recommendations }} </div>
</div>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  async fetch({ $store, $route }) {
    const { data } = await axios.get(`/api/my-recommendations/${$route.params.id}`)
    $store.commit('updateRecommandations', data)
  }

  async asyncData({ $route }) {
    const { data } = await axios.get(`/api/my-data/${$route.params.id}`)
    return { name: data.name }
  }
}
</script>
```

# Installation

**npm**

```bash
npm install liyupku2000/vue-component-holder --save
```

**yarn**

```bash
yarn add liyupku2000/vue-component-holder
```

Add the following at webpack.config.js -> module.exports -> modules -> rules -> (vue) -> use -> options:

```js
compilerModules: [{
  postTransformNode: require('vue-compoent-holder/holdify')()
}]
```

Install the plugin (details in [Installation Options](#Installation-Options)):

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueComponentHolder from 'vue-compoent-holder'

Vue.use(VueComponentHolder, {
  // plugin options
})
```

After installation, you can simply wrap your component in the template as follows:

```html
<vue-holder name="YourFavoriteName">
  <MyChildComponent />
</vue-holder>
```

Please refer the [demo project](https://github.com/liyupku2000/vue-component-holder) for more usage examples.

# Holdify

If the child component is in "v-for" loop(s), it could have multiple mvm instances. In this case, the holdify function will add more attributes on the wrapping "vud-holder". For example, the "uid" attribute is used to identify different mvms, and the "vars" attribute is for passing local variables to the render function of the mvm. Please view our holdify examples or try it yourself on [Holdify Demo](https://github.com/liyupku2000/vue-component-holder).

# Installation Options

**globalHolderMixin**

This option is default to "true". If it is "false", you need to setup "HolderMixin" manually in those components which are using "vue-holder" or wrapped by "vue-holder".

```js
/** MyParentComponent.vue */
import { HolderMixin } from 'vue-compoent-holder'
export default {
  mixins: [ HolderMixin /* more mixins*/ ]
}
```

```js
/** MyChildComponent.vue */
import { HolderMixin } from 'vue-compoent-holder'
export default {
  mixins: [ HolderMixin /* more mixins*/ ]
}
```

**customHooks**

You could inject asynchronized custom hooks in the parent component. They are partitioned into two groups: "preInitMvms" and "postInitMvms", indicating they are excuted before or after the mvms are initialized.

```js
/** MyParentComponent.vue */
Vue.use(VueComponentHolder, {
  customHooks: {
    preInitMvms: [ 'beforeInit' ],
    postInitMvms: [ 'inited' ]
  }
})

export default {
  async beforeInit() {
  },

  async inited() {
  }
}
```
