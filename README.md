# Introduction

This plugin introduces a component placeholder machanism. A placeholder component replaces the original child component, and the plugin manages the creation/mounting/destroy of the child component by itself. This child component then becomes an "mvm" (managed vm). If vue updates the placeholder component, the plugin applies the same change to the mvm. Since the mvm is totally managed by the plugin, we could inject some (asynchronized) custom hooks before and after its creation, making it handy to work with asynchronous data. For example, this plugin injects an "asyncData" hook on each mvm to prefetch asynchronous data ([Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/api/) is only able to do it on page components).

To declare an mvm, just wrap a child component with "vue-holder" as follows:

```html
<!-- MyParentComponent.vue -->
<template>
<div>
  <vue-holder name="MyFavoriteName">
    <MyChildComponent />
  </vue-holder>
</template>
```

To prevent vue from creating/managing mvms, we need to edit the template AST generated by [vue-component-compiler](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-component-compiler). This is done by the "holdify" function we inject into "vue-loader" (details in [Installation](#Installation)). In the previous example, the child's template is moved from the default slot to the template attribute as follows:

```html
<vue-holder name="MyFavoriteName" template="<MyChildComponent />">
</vue-holder>
```

Then, the plugin could make the mvm's render function based on the result of "holdify". Before running the render function, it could run some asynchronized hooks first (declared as follows):

```js
/** MyChildComponent.vue */
<template>
<div>
  <div>Name: {{ name }}</div>
  <div>Recommendations: {{ $store.state.recommendations }} </div>
</div>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  async fetch({ $store, $route }) {
    const { data } = await axios.get(`/api/my-recommendations/${$route.params.id}`)
    $store.commit('updateRecommandations', data)
  },

  async asyncData({ $route }) {
    const { data } = await axios.get(`/api/my-data/${$route.params.id}`)
    return { name: data.name }
  }
}
</script>
```

# Installation

**npm**

```bash
npm install vue-component-holder --save
```

**yarn**

```bash
yarn add vue-component-holder
```

Add the following at webpack.config.js -> module.exports -> modules -> rules -> (vue) -> use -> options:

```js
compilerModules: [{
  postTransformNode: require('vue-compoent-holder/holdify')()
}]
```

Or the following in vue.config.js:

```js
module.exports = {
  chainWebpack: config => {
    config.module
      .rule('vue')
      .use('vue-loader')
        .loader('vue-loader')
        .tap(options => {
            options.compilerModules = options.compilerModules || [];
            options.compilerModules.push({
              postTransformNode: require('vue-component-holder/holdify')()
            })
            return options
        })
  }
}
```

Install the plugin (details in [Installation Options](#Installation-Options)):

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueComponentHolder from 'vue-compoent-holder'

Vue.use(VueComponentHolder, {
  // plugin options
})
```

After installation, you can simply wrap your component in the template:

```html
<vue-holder name="YourFavoriteName">
  <MyChildComponent />
</vue-holder>
```

Please refer the [demo project](https://github.com/liyupku2000/vue-component-holder-demo) for more usage examples.

# Holdify

If the child component is in "v-for" loop(s), it could have multiple mvm instances. In this case, the holdify function will add more attributes on the placeholder component. For example, the "uid" attribute is added to identify different mvms, and the "vars" attribute is added to pass local variables to the mvm's render function. Please view our holdify examples or try it yourself on [Holdify Demo](https://github.com/liyupku2000/holdify-demo).

# Installation Options

**globalHolderMixin**

This option is default to "true". If it is "false", you need to setup "HolderMixin" manually as follows:

```js
/** MyParentComponent.vue */
import { HolderMixin } from 'vue-compoent-holder'
export default {
  mixins: [ HolderMixin /* more mixins*/ ]
}
```

```js
/** MyChildComponent.vue */
import { HolderMixin } from 'vue-compoent-holder'
export default {
  mixins: [ HolderMixin /* more mixins*/ ]
}
```

**customHooks**

You could inject asynchronized custom hooks in the parent component. They are partitioned into two groups: "preInitMvms" and "postInitMvms", indicating they are excuted before or after the mvms are initialized.

```js
/** MyParentComponent.vue */
Vue.use(VueComponentHolder, {
  customHooks: {
    preInitMvms: [ 'beforeInit' ],
    postInitMvms: [ 'inited' ]
  }
})

export default {
  async beforeInit() {
  },

  async inited() {
  }
}
```

# APIs and Hooks

Please refer the [demo project](https://github.com/liyupku2000/vue-component-holder-demo) for their usage examples.

**$intf**

This function could retrieve the interface object of a specific mvm with the holder name and uid.

**$publish (or @Public)**

The "$publish" function is used to publish the properties of a mvm within its interface object.
With [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component), you could publish a property of a mvm with the "@Public" decorator.

**mvmsUpdated**

A hook, defined in the parent component, is called everytime there are some mvms created/deleted/updated.

**asyncData**

A hook, defined in the child component, is called before an mvm is created, which helps to fetch async data.

**fetch**

A hook, defined in the child component, is called before an mvm is created, which helps to update stores.
